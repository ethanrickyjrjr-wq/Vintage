We’re happy to share with you what’s arriving in Safari 26.0! It includes big exciting new features, many important improvements, and lots of attention to detail. We can’t wait to see what you do with Anchor Positioning, Scroll-driven animations, High Dynamic Range images, the new HTML `<model>` element, the all-new Digital Credentials API, SVG icon support, WebGPU, WebKit in SwiftUI, and much, much more.
Now every site can be a web app on iOS and iPadOS. Safari in visionOS supports a wider range of immersive media, with spatial videos, Apple Immersive Video, and 180°, 360° & Wide FOV videos. Users can report issues they are having with websites directly from Safari. And there are new features for Web Inspector, Web Extensions, Content Blockers, Lockdown Mode, Device Management, WebKit API and more.
Safari 26.0 adds 75 new features, 3 deprecations, and 171 other improvements. That’s 12% more features and 59% more bug fixes than we announced in June at WWDC.
##  CSS
###  Anchor Positioning
Anchor positioning is a new layout mechanism for anchoring one element to another on the web. It pairs well with the `popover` attribute (which shipped in Safari 17.0), making it easy to create responsive menus, tooltips and more.
The easiest way to use anchor positioning is by using `position-area`, which lets you position elements (the “anchor-positioned”) in pre-defined areas relative to another element (the “anchor”). For example, to position an element on the top right corner of an anchor, it’s as simple as `position-area: top right`:

```
.thing-that-gets-anchored-to {
  anchor-name: --profile-button;
}

.item-that-pops-up {
  position: absolute;
  position-anchor: --profile-button;
  position-area: top right;
} 

```

For more advanced use cases, the `anchor()` CSS function calculates the inset value required to line up the edges of the anchor and anchor-positioned elements together. This example achieves the same effect as above, but using `anchor()` instead:

```
.thing-that-gets-anchored-to {
  anchor-name: --profile-button;
}

.item-that-pops-up {
  position: absolute;
  position-anchor: --profile-button;
  bottom: anchor(top);
  left: anchor(right);
}

```

Above, the `anchor(top)` in `bottom: anchor(top)` calculates to a value that lines up the bottom edge of the anchor-positioned to the top edge of the anchor. Similarly, `left: anchor(right)` lines up the right edge of the anchor-positioned to the left edge of the anchor.
As `anchor()` calculates to a value, it can be used in `calc()` for more advanced use cases: exact-to-the-pixel layout, anchoring to multiple anchors, or animated anchors. But for everything else, just stick to the pre-defined areas using `position-area.` The `position-area` syntax came from a proposal we put together, as we thought about how developers would use Anchor Positioning, and how overwhelming it’d be to manually line up edges together using `anchor().`
You can also use `position-try` to provide alternative positions when there’s not enough room to display element. For example, to place the element on the bottom right corner when there isn’t enough space on the top right corner, use `position-try: bottom right`.

```
.thing-that-gets-anchored-to {
  anchor-name: --profile-button;
}

.item-that-pops-up {
  position: absolute;
  position-anchor: --profile-button;
  position-area: top right;
  position-try: bottom right;
} 

```
![Code using Anchor Positioning with the results. Watch our WWDC25 session for a walkthrough of this example. ](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Anchor-Positioning-slide-from-WWDC25.jpeg)Learn more about Anchor Positioning, and watch a full walkthrough of this example in [What’s new in Safari and WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/233/) at WWDC25.
New since [the first beta](https://webkit.org/blog/16993/news-from-wwdc25-web-technology-coming-this-fall-in-safari-26-beta/), Safari 26.0 supports [implicit `anchor` elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#implicit_anchor_association) for pseudo-elements with anchor functions.
To learn more about the anchor positioning, consult our [gentle introduction to anchor positioning](https://webkit.org/blog/17240/a-gentle-introduction-to-anchor-positioning/). You can also catch the full walkthrough of using anchor positioning in our WWDC25 session, [What’s new in Safari and WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/233/).
###  Scroll-driven animations
Scroll-driven animations lets you tie CSS animations to either the timeline of just how far the user has scrolled, or to how far particular content has moved through the viewport, in and out of view.
For example, let’s imagine you want to animate a group of items as they scroll into view.
![Cards on a webpage, scrolled into the viewport, completing their animation \(turning to land flat\), as they reach 50%.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Scroll-driven-animations-at-WWDC25-scaled.png)
You can declare that you want the animation to be tied to whether or not they are in view with `animation-timeline: view()`, and specify that the animation should begin just as each item is 0% visible and end when they are 50% across the viewport with `animation-range: 0% 50%`.

```
.item {
  animation-fill-mode: both;
  animation-timeline: view();
  animation-range: 0% 50%;
  &:nth-child(3n + 1) { animation-name: in-from-left; }
  &:nth-child(3n + 2) { animation-name: in-from-middle; }
  &:nth-child(3n + 3) { animation-name: in-from-right; }
}

```

Watch [What’s new in Safari and WebKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/233/) at WWDC25 to see the full walkthrough of this example, and learn more about what’s possible with Scroll-driven animations.
###  Pretty text
Safari 26.0 adds support for `text-wrap: pretty`. Our implementation of `pretty` adjusts how text wraps in an effort to even out the ragged edge, improve hyphenation, and prevent short last lines.
![Demo of the same text, only now with better rag. The "guides" show three vertical lines about 50 pixels apart — the far right edge is marked with a red line. 45 pixels in from the left is a vertical green line. And another 45 pixels left of that line is a vertical magenta line.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/demo-2-light.png)
In WebKit, all lines of text in an element are improved by `pretty`, not just a select group of lines at the end of the paragraph. To learn more, read [Better typography with text-wrap pretty](https://webkit.org/blog/16547/better-typography-with-text-wrap-pretty/).
###  Contrast Color
Safari 26.0 adds support for the `contrast-color()` function. It gives you the chance to declare a color that’s either black or white, depending on which will provide more contrast with a second color.
For example, we can make a button with the background color of `var(--button-color)`, and then ask the browser to set the text `color` to either black or white, whichever one provides more contrast against that background.

```
button {
  background-color: var(--button-color);
  color: contrast-color(var(--button-color));
}

```

Now, when the `--button-color` variable is set, both the background and text colors are chosen. Try picking different colors in this demo to see it in action:
Learn much more about `contrast-color()`, including the accessibility implications, by reading [How to have the browser pick a contrasting color in CSS](https://webkit.org/blog/16929/contrast-color/).
###  Progress function
Safari 26.0 adds support for the CSS `progress()` function. It’s a math function that returns a number value representing how far along something is, how much progress it’s made between two other values.

```
progress(<progress-value>, <progress-start>, <progress-end>)

```

For example, let’s say you want to know how far along a width of a box is, compared to a specific start width and end width.

```
--percent-of-box-width: progress(100cqw, 300px, 600px);

```

Let’s imagine at a particular moment, the is container 450px wide. That’s half way in-between 300px and 600px. The `progress()` function will calculate this to be 50% using this formula:

```
(progress value - progress start value) / (progress end value - progress start value)

```

The result is always a number without any unit. Notice you can mix lengths with different units.
Be mindful that currently `progress` [doesn’t clamp](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/11825). So it won’t stop at 0% or 100%. It will just grow above 100%, or shrink down below 0%.
The `progress()` function is most powerful when used with other complex math. Combine with animations, gradients, or scroll timelines, and connect one set of conditions with another. There might be even more functions with which it could be combined [coming to CSS in the future](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/6245#issuecomment-2661545284).
###  And more CSS
![diagrams of how margin-trim affects layout — before and after.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/margin-trim-simple-scaled.png)
Safari 26.0 now supports the `margin-trim: block inline` syntax for trimming in both directions. Learn all about `margin-trim` and what the `block inline` value does in [Easier layout with margin-trim](https://webkit.org/blog/16854/margin-trim/).
The `overflow-block` and `overflow-inline` properties are supported in Safari 26.0. They are the [logical versions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_logical_properties_and_values/Basic_concepts_of_logical_properties_and_values) of `overflow-x` and `overflow-y`, making it even easier to write robust code that supports multiple languages.
Safari 26.0 supports the self-alignment properties `align-self` and `justify-self` in absolute positioning.
There are two features in CSS that are new since the Safari 26 beta announcements at WWDC25. Safari 26.0 now supports the `animation-range`, `animation-range-start`, `animation-range-end`, and `animation-timeline` properties for `::marker`. It also adds support for allowing declarations directly inside `@scope` rule without a style rule ancestor.
##  Every site can be a web app on iOS and iPadOS
Since January 2008 with iPhone OS 1.1.3, users on iPhone could add website icons to their Home Screen for quick access. Tapping the icon opened the site in Safari. By August 2008 with iPhone OS 2.1, web developers could instead trigger their site to appear in an app-like “[standalone mode](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40002051-CH3-SW2)” by adding the `<meta name='apple-mobile-web-app-capable'>` tag to the HTML head.
In 2013, the W3C began standardizing Web Application Manifests to make configuring web app behavior possible with a JSON manifest file. Browser support started in November 2014, and Safari adopted in March 2018 with iOS 11.4.
For the last 17 years, if the website had the specific `meta` tag or Web Application Manifest `display` value in it’s code, when a user added it to their Home Screen on iOS or iPadOS, tapping its icon opened it as a web app. If the website was not configured as such, tapping its icon opened the site in a browser. Users had no choice in the matter, nor visible way to understand why some sites behaved one way while others behaved another.
On Mac, we took a different approach. When introducing [Web Apps on Mac](https://webkit.org/blog/14205/news-from-wwdc23-webkit-features-in-safari-17-beta/#web-apps) in Sep 2023, we made the decision to always open websites added to the Dock as web apps. It doesn’t matter whether or not the website has a Web Application Manifest. Users get a consistent [experience](https://support.apple.com/en-us/104996). Add to Dock creates a web app.
Now, we are revising the behavior on iOS 26 and iPadOS 26. By default, every website added to the Home Screen opens as a web app. If the user prefers to add a bookmark for their browser, they can disable “Open as Web App” when adding to Home Screen — even if the site is configured to be a web app. The UI is always consistent, no matter how the site’s code is configured. And the power to define the experience is in the hands of users.
![iPhone in the process of adding a website to the Home Screen. The UI shows the site icon, editable name, and a toggle turned on to Open as Web App.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/Add-to-Home-Screen-light-NEW.png)
This change, of course, is _not_ removing any of WebKit’s current support for web app features. If you include a Web Application Manifest with your site, the benefits it provides will be part of the user’s experience. If you define your icons in the manifest, they’re used.
We value the principles of progressive enhancement and separation of concerns. All of the same web technology is available to you as a developer, to build the experience you would like to build. Giving users a web app experience simply no longer _requires_ a manifest file. It’s similar to how Home Screen web apps on iOS and iPadOS never required Service Workers ([as PWAs](https://docs.pwabuilder.com/#/home/pwa-intro?id=what-makes-a-pwa) do on other platforms), yet including Service Workers in your code can greatly enhance the user experience.
Simply put, there are now zero requirements for “installability” in Safari. Users can add any site to their Home Screen and open it as a web app on iOS26 and iPadOS26.
##  HDR images
The human eye can typically handle seeing things lit by bright light and sitting in dark shadows at the same time. The contrast your eyes see between brightness and darkness is called dynamic range, and it’s very challenging to reproduce.
As digital photography and videography improved by leaps and bounds over the years, the ability to digitally capture a dynamic range has greatly improved. The High Dynamic Range (HDR) format takes this even further, allowing you to capture both a wider dynamic range and increased color gamut, creating more vivid and realistic-looking images and video. Parallel breakthroughs in display technology have made it possible to present such images for others to view, with deep true blacks, pure bright whites and dramatic nuances in between.
WebKit shipped support for HDR video in 2020, in Safari 14.0. Now, in Safari 26.0 for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 and visionOS 26, WebKit adds support for HDR images on the web. You can embed images with high dynamic range into a webpage, just like other images — including images in WebGPU Canvas.
WebKit for Safari 26.0 also adds support for the new `dynamic-range-limit` property in CSS. This property lets you control what happens when presenting a mix of standard dynamic range (SDR) and HDR video or images together. Safari 26.0 supports the `no-limit` and `standard` values. Using `no-limit` tells the browser to let content be as is — HDR content is presented in HDR. Using `standard` converts all of the HDR content to SDR, and displays it within the limits of standard dynamic range. Doing so prevents HDR images and video from appearing overly bright or out of place next to SDR content, which can be especially helpful when users or third-parties provide content.
##  Immersive video and audio on visionOS
Safari in visionOS 26 now supports a wider range of immersive media, including spatial videos and Apple Immersive Video, and 180°, 360°, and Wide FOV (field of view) videos that conform to the new Apple Projected Media Profile (APMP). Embed your video on a webpage, and let users play it back immersively on a curved surface in 3D space.
![A diagram of the five kinds of immersive media — Spatial, 180 degree, 360 degree, wide FOV \(field of view\), Apple Immersive](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/immerisve-media-continuum-scaled.png)
This support includes HTTP Live Streaming for all of these immersive media types. The existing [HLS tools](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/using-apple-s-http-live-streaming-hls-tools) have been updated to support APMP segmentation, and the [HLS specification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http-live-streaming/hls-authoring-specification-for-apple-devices) has been updated with information on how to identify immersive media in an HLS manifest file.
Learn more about `model` and immersive video by watching [What’s new for the spatial web](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/237/) at WWDC25.
##  <model> on visionOS
Now on visionOS, Safari supports the `<model>` element. It’s a brand new HTML element that’s similar to `img` or `video` — only now you can embed interactive 3D models into the webpage, and let users interact with them with a single attribute. And if they want to see your models in their own space at real size, they can drag the models off the page with a single gesture.
###  Basic usage
The syntax for showing a model is simple. Using the same USDZ files that work with [AR Quick Look](https://webkit.org/blog/8421/viewing-augmented-reality-assets-in-safari-for-ios/) today, you can set the `src` attribute of the `model` element:

```
<model src="teapot.usdz">
  <img src="fallback/teapot.jpg" alt="a teapot">
</model>

```

###  Lighting
Lighting is an important part of making your 3D content look good, and the model element makes that straightforward too. You can apply an environment map as any image, including the high-dynamic range OpenEXR `.exr` and Radiance HDR `.hdr` formats by setting the `environmentmap` attribute:

```
<model src="teapot.usdz" environmentmap="night.hdr">
  <img src="fallback/teapot-night.jpg" alt="a teapot at night">
</model>

```

###  Animation and playback
You can work with models containing animated content too. Use the `autoplay` attribute to declaratively set a model’s animation to run as soon as it loads, keep the animation going using the `loop` attribute,

```
<model autoplay loop src="teapot-animated.usdz">
  <img src="fallback/teapot-animated.jpg" alt="a teapot with a stowaway!">
</model>

```

or use the JavaScript API for more fine-grained control:

```
const model = document.querySelector('model');
model.playbackRate = 0.5; //set 50% speed
model.currentTime = 6; //set the animation to 6 seconds in
model.play();

```

###  Rotation and interaction
To let users spin and tumble a model themselves, set the model’s `stagemode` attribute to `orbit` and everything will be handled for you.

```
<model stagemode="orbit" src="teapot.usdz">
  <img src="fallback/teapot-orbit.jpg" alt="a teapot for examining">
</model>

```

Or if you’re after programmatic control, models can be scaled, rotated and moved (translated) using their `entityTransform` property, which can takes a [`DOMMatrix`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMMatrix) value. You can compose these with functions like `translate`, `rotate` and `scale3d` to orient the model the way you want.

```
<model id="rotating-teapot" src="teapot.usdz">
  <img src="fallback/teapot-rotater.jpg" alt="a teapot for turning">
</model>

```

With this JavaScript:

```
const rotatingTeapot = document.getElementById("rotating-teapot");
await rotatingTeapot.ready;
function rotate() {
  rotatingTeapot.entityTransform = new DOMMatrix().rotate(0, performance.now()/10,0);
  requestAnimationFrame(rotate);
}
rotate();

```

There’s a lot more to discover about the model element and what you can do with it. Check out the [Model element samples](https://immersive-web.github.io/model-element-samples/) and the [expected documentation](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/39710) for MDN.
##  Digital Credentials API
WebKit for Safari 26.0 adds support for the [W3C’s Digital Credentials API](https://w3c-fedid.github.io/digital-credentials/). In jurisdictions that have issued such credentials, this API allows a website to securely request identity documents (like a driver’s license) from Apple Wallet or other iOS applications that have registered themselves as an Identity Document Provider.
The Digital Credential API is useful for situations where a high-trust credential is needed to access a service online (perhaps renting an automobile). It provides a much safer and user friendly alternative to, for example, a user uploading a photograph of their driver’s license.
The Digital Credentials API leverages the existing [Credential Management API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API) and introduces a “`digital`” member for requesting identity documents. Requesting an identity document relies on the [ISO/IEC 18013-7 Annex C](https://www.iso.org/standard/82772.html) international standard, which is identified by the protocol string `"org-iso-mdoc"`.
For example, to request an end-user’s driver’s license, you might do something like this. Create a button in HTML:

```
<button onclick="verifyIdentity">Verify Identity</button>

```

And then in JavaScript:

```
async function verifyIdentity() {
    try {
        // Server generated and cryptography signed request data.
        const response = await fetch("drivers/license/data");
        const data = await response.json();

        // Create the request.
        const request = {
            protocol: "org-iso-mdoc",
            // What is being rquested, e.g. person's driving privileges 
            data,
        };

        // Perform presentment request.
        // Must be done through a user gesture!
        const credential = await navigator.credentials.get({
            mediation: "required",
            digital: {
                requests: [request],
            },
        });

        // Send credential to server for decryption.
        const response = await fetch("/decrypt", {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify(credential.data),
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        });

        // Display it...
        const json = await response.json();
        presentDetails(json);
    } catch (err) {
        // Deal with any errors...
    }
}

```

New since WWDC, Digital Credentials API now includes support for the `DigitalCredential.userAgentAllowsProtocol()` static method. This method allows you check if a particular digital credential request protocol is allowed. For example:

```
   if (DigitalCredential.userAgentAllowsProtocol("org-iso-mdoc")) {
     // Create an mDoc request
   } else {
     // Fallback to some other credential request format
   }

```

To learn more about this transformative technology watch [Verify identity documents on the web](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/232/) at WWDC25.
By the way, Digital Credentials is not yet supported in WKWebView. You can follow WebKit bug [268516](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=293646) for updates. Also, Digital Credentials API currently has an known issue where mixed protocol requests containing both OpenID4VP and ISO 18013-7 (Annex C) protocols may cause an infinite loading spinner on iOS when scanning QR codes from Chrome on macOS during cross-device identity verification flows.
##  Web API
Web developers can use the Trusted Types API, now in Safari 26.0, to ensure that end user input does not lead to client-side cross-site scripting (XSS). The API guarantees that input can be sanitized using a developer-specified function before being passed to vulnerable APIs.
We’ve added support for the URL Pattern Standard, which provides an efficient and performant way for web developers to match URLs using regular expressions through the `URLPattern` object. For instance, if your blog posts follow the pattern of `/blog/title-of-the-post` you could match them as follows:

```
const pattern = new URLPattern({ pathname: "/blog/:title" });
pattern.test("https://example.org/blog/wwdc25"); // true
pattern.test("https://example.org/about"); // false

```

Coming to Safari 26.0 is the WebAuthn Signal API, which allows websites to report credential updates (like username changes or revocations) to credential providers, ensuring a more accurate and consistent user experience with passkeys. The new `PublicKeyCredential.signal` ** methods enable websites to communicate these changes, improving credential management and streamlining sign-in flows. This enhancement empowers websites to provide a more seamless and secure WebAuthn experience.
There’s also now support for the File System WritableStream API, enabling direct writing to files within the user’s file system. This API provides an efficient and streamlined way to save data, allowing developers to build applications with enhanced file handling capabilities, such as direct downloads and in-place file editing.
WebKit for Safari 26.0 adds support for the `alg` parameter when importing or exporting Edward’s-curve based JSON Web Keys in WebCrypto.
Support for `scrollMargin` in `IntersectionObserver` is here for more precise intersection detection. This allows you to define margins around the root element, similar to `rootMargin`, providing finer control over when intersection events are triggered.
New since Safari 26 beta 1, the `<dialog>` element now supports the `toggle` event which can be used to watch for whenever the dialog gets opened or closed. And now supports [Scoped Custom Element Registry](https://wicg.github.io/webcomponents/proposals/Scoped-Custom-Element-Registries.html).
WebKit for Safari 26.0 also removed the `getSVGDocument()` method from `HTMLFrameElement` to align with the most recent specification.
##  JavaScript
WebKit for Safari 26.0 adds support for [Pattern Modifiers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Modifier) in JavaScript’s `RegExp` objects. Pattern modifiers allow more fine-grained control over the behavior of regular expressions through adding and removing flags within a regular expression.
New since WWDC25, WebKit for Safari 26.0 adds support for the `notation` option for `Intl.PluralRules` and the `Intl.Locale.prototype.variants` getter.
##  SVG icons
Safari 26.0 now supports the SVG file format for icons everyplace there are icons in the interface, including favicons.
For years, favicons were just displayed in the browser window’s URL bar, or in a menu of favorites. Now, icons show up in a range of places across browsers, at wildly different sizes. That includes the Safari start page, where icons represent content in Reading List, iCloud Tabs, Suggestions and Favorites. For web apps, this same icon represents the website on the user’s Home Screen or in their Dock. And icons are, of course, used in Safari tabs and menus.
By using an SVG file for your icon, you leverage infinite vector scaling. You rely on Safari to do the work of creating rasterized icons at multiple sizes to be used in various locations. And an SVG file is also often a smaller download than the .png files commonly used for favicons.
[Data URL images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes/data) are also now supported for icons as well, allowing you to express small image files as code.
##  WebGPU
WebKit for Safari 26.0 adds support for WebGPU.
A beautiful example of WebGPU in action, [Realtime procedural jellyfish in the browser](https://holtsetio.com/lab/aurelia/) by Niklas Niehus.
WebGPU, a JavaScript API for running programs on the GPU, is similar to WebGL in its capabilities for graphics and rendering. Additionally, it adds compute shaders, which allow general purpose computations on the GPU, something not previously possible with WebGL.
WebGPU supersedes WebGL on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS and is preferred for new sites and web apps. It maps better to [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/), and the underlying hardware. Comparatively, WebGL required significant translation overhead due to being derived from OpenGL which was designed prior to modern GPUs.
GPU programs are provided by the website or web app using the WebGPU Shading Language, known as WGSL (pronounced _wig-sill)_. It’s a new language that is verifiably safe for the web unlike some existing shading languages which allow for unchecked bounds accesses and pointer arithmetic.
WebGPU has been enabled in Safari Technology Preview for over a year, and is now shipping in Safari 26.0 for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. Given the level of hardware access provided by WebGPU, much consideration was taken to ensure WebGPU does not expose new security attack surfaces. Additionally, validation performed was streamlined recently to minimize overhead and maintain closer to native application performance.
As a developer you are most likely to leverage the power of WebGPU through a framework. Currently, [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), [Unity](https://unity.com/), [PlayCanvas](https://playcanvas.com/), [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index), [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) and others all work great in Safari 26.0.
Learn more by watching [Unlock GPU computing with WebGPU](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/236/) at WWDC25.
##  Media
Safari 26.0 also adds support for ALAC and PCM audio in MediaRecorder.

```
const video = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
const recorder = new MediaRecorder(video, {
    mimeType: "audio/mp4; codecs=alac",
});

```

Safari 26.0 expands support for [WebCodecs API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebCodecs_API) by adding [AudioEncoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioEncoder) and [AudioDecoder](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioDecoder). WebCodecs gives developers low-level access to the individual frames of a video stream and chunks of audio. These additions make it possible to encode [`AudioData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioData) objects and decode [`EncodedAudioChunk`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EncodedAudioChunk) objects.
Safari 26.0 now includes several improvements for [Media Source API (MSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API). It adds support for `detachable` MediaSource objects to allow for seamless switching between objects attached to a media element. And it adds support for MediaSource prefers `DecompressionSession`.
And new since Safari 26 beta 1, WebKit now supports for in-band tracks in MSE.
##  WebRTC
WebKit brings multiple updates for WebRTC, adding support for:
  * Exposing CSRC information for RTCEncodedVideoStream
  * Speaker Selection API on iOS and iPadOS
  * Serialisation of RTCEncodedAudioFrame and RTCEncodedVideoFrame
  * `ImageCapture.grabFrame`
  * `RTcRtpScriptTransformer.generateKeyFrame` to take a `rid` parameter
  * RTCEncodedAudioFrame and RTCEncodedVideoFrame constructors


New since WWDC25, Webkit for Safari 26.0 now supports exposing a default system speaker device.
And Safari 26.0 removed the `fec` and `rtx` from WebRTC encoding parameters.
##  Editing
To further support users as they edit content on the web, Safari 26.0 adds rendering native selection UI inside scrolled content.
##  HTTP
Also new since our announcements at WWDC25, Safari 26.0 now adds support for WebSocket over HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
##  SVG
For SVG `group` containers, Safari 26.0 adds support for `pointer-events="bounding-box"`.
##  Website compatibility
###  Report a website issue
Now in Safari on macOS, iOS, and iPadOS, users can report an issue anytime they are having trouble with a webpage.
![Safari on iPhone showing UI labeled "Report an issue" in the Page menu.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/report-an-issue-light-NEW.png)
If you seem to have trouble that you don’t expect, first try reloading the page. If there’s still a problem, go to the Page menu, where you’ll find “Report a Website issue…” This brings up a quick set of multiple choice questions that provide the key information for us to spot patterns and better ensure a great experience in Safari.
###  Update to UA String
Also, now in Safari on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS 26 the user agent string no longer lists the current version of the operating system. Safari 18.6 on iOS has a UA string of:

```
 Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.6 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1

```

And Safari 26.0 on iOS has a UA string of:

```
 Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1

```

This matches the long-standing behavior on macOS, where the user agent string for Safari 26.0 is:

```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/26.0 Safari/605.1.15` 

```

It was back in 2017 when Safari on Mac first started freezing the Mac OS string. Now the behavior on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS does the same in order to minimize compatibility issues. The WebKit and Safari version number portions of the string will continue to change with each release.
Meanwhile, we highly recommend using [feature detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Testing/Feature_detection) instead of [UA string detection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Browser_detection_using_the_user_agent) when writing conditional code.
##  Web Inspector
###  Automatic inspection of Service Workers
To inspect a Service Worker you need to open a Web Inspector from Safari’s Develop menu. That’s because the execution context of a Service Worker is independent of the page that installed it. But the action handled by a Service Worker might have already occurred by the time you get to it via the Develop menu. This can happen, for example, with Web Push events where the Service Worker has already handled the incoming push.
To address this, Safari 26.0 introduces automatic inspection and pausing of Service Workers. This is similar to the existing feature for automatic inspection and pausing of JSContexts. To use it, open the Inspect Apps and Devices tool from the Develop menu. Identify the app or Home Screen Web App that uses a Service Worker you want to inspect and, from the three-dots menu, select the option labeled _Automatically Inspect New Service Workers_. The next time a Service Worker runs in that app, a Web Inspector window will open automatically for it. Use the _Automatically Pause New Service Workers_ option to also pause JavaScript execution in the Service Worker as soon as it’s inspected. This allows you to set breakpoints and step through the code as actions are handled.
![Screenshot of the Apps and Devices Inspection window](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/device-inspection-light-2.png)
###  Recording Workers in the Timelines tab
Safari 26.0 makes it easier to debug Worker-related memory and performance issues using the Timelines tab in Web Inspector. Breakpoints, profiling data, events, call trees, and heap snapshots are now correctly attributed to each Worker and not its associated page. JavaScript code that runs in a Worker may also call `debugger`, `console.profile`, etc to supplement timeline data with application-specific milestones. Lastly, it is now possible to export and import data gathered from Workers in a Timeline recording.
![Screenshot of Web Inspector Timelines tab, with all kinds of information about JavaScript events across time. ](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/timelines-tab-light.png)
###  Slotted badge
The Elements node tree in Web Inspector now shows a badge labeled _Slotted_ next to nodes that have been inserted into corresponding `<slot>` nodes within Custom Elements. Click the badge to expand the node tree into the Shadow DOM of the Custom Element and jump to the `<slot>` node. If there is a correspondence, the `<slot>` node has a badge labelled _Assigned_ next to it. Click this badge to jump to the node from the light DOM that is slotted here.
![Screenshot of Web Inspector Elements tab.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/elements-slotted-node-light.png)
###  Improved async debugging experience
The Web Inspector debugger has been updated to provide a more intuitive debugging experience for asynchronous code. You can now step over an `await` statement as if it were synchronous, meaning the debugger will skip the underlying asynchronous mechanics and move to the next line of code in the function. This simplifies debugging because it allows you to focus on the intended logic of your code, rather than the potentially confusing execution path introduced by `await`.
###  New in Web Inspector since Safari 26 beta 1
Web Inspector adds support for two newer CSS features — `@starting-style` and `@scope` styles (in the Styles sidebar).
Safari 26.0 adds supports for the console to log both the URI and the time when entering a new navigation context. And adds supported for `console.profile` in `Worker`.
Web Inspector now supports exporting and importing data from worker targets in the Timelines tab.
##  WebKit in SwiftUI
WebKit has a brand-new API designed from the ground up to work with [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). This makes it easier than ever to integrate web content into apps built for Apple platforms.
The core parts of this new API are the new `WebView` and `WebPage` types.
###  WebView
To display your web content, simply use the new `WebView` type, a brand-new native [SwiftUI View](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view). All you need to do is give it a URL to display.

```
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        WebView(
            url: URL(string: "https://www.webkit.org")
        )
    }
}

```

`WebView` also supports a powerful set of new and existing view modifiers, like `webViewScrollPosition`, `webViewMagnificationGestures`, `findNavigator`, and more. For more advanced customization, like being able to react to changes in the content, you’ll need to connect it to a `WebPage`.
###  WebPage
WebPage is a brand new Observable class that can be used to load, control, and communicate with web content. You can even use it completely on its own, in cases where you don’t need to display the page directly to your users. But when you do, combining it with WebView allows you to build rich experiences, and integrate the web into your app with ease. WebPage has a full set of observable properties and functions you can use to make reacting to changes incredibly simple, especially with SwiftUI.
The new `URLSchemeHandler` protocol makes it super easy to implement handling custom schemes so that local resources and files can be used in your app. It leverages the full capabilities of Swift and Swift Concurrency, and you just need to provide it with an `AsyncSequence`.
`WebPage.NavigationDeciding` is a new protocol that lets you customize how navigation policies should behave in your app across different stages of a navigation. In addition to `WebPage.NavigationDeciding`, there’s also `WebPage.DialogPresenting` to customize how dialogs presented from JS should be displayed.

```
struct ArticleView: View {
    @Environment(ArticleViewModel.self) private var model

    var body: some View {
        WebView(model.page)
            .navigationTitle(model.page.title)
    }
}

```

We look forward to seeing what [Apple Developers](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) do with the new `WebPage` and `WebView` types for Swift and SwiftUI. As a web developer, it’s now easier than ever for you to use the skills you have to create an app for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS.
![Screenshot of an iPad app, with a menu created in Swift, and content that is pulled from the web.](https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/webkit-in-swift-ui-example-app-light-scaled.png)
To learn more about the new SwiftUI WebKit API, watch [Meet WebKit for SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/231/) at WWDC25, and explore the API in the developer documentation on [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/).
##  WebKit API
Several improvements to WebKit API are available now in iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS beta.
  * Screen Time support
  * Local storage and session storage restoration APIs for WKWebView
  * The ability to applying `backdrop-filter` to content behind a transparent webview


A new `obscuredContentInsets` property added to WKWebView allows developers to specify areas of the web view that are covered by browser UI elements like tab bars or toolbars. Set this property to automatically adjust the layout viewport so web content renders within the visible area without being obscured by overlapping interface elements.
WebKit also deprecated WKProcessPool and WKSelectionGranularity.
##  Web Extensions
The new web-based Safari Web Extension Packager allows developers to take their existing web extension resources and prepare them for testing in Safari through TestFlight and distribution through the App Store. The tool is available in App Store Connect and uses Xcode Cloud to package the extension resources you provide into a signed app + extension bundle that can be used in Safari on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. Learn more about using the tool in our documentation on [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/).
Web Extension [commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/commands) are now shown in the menubar on macOS and iPadOS. On macOS, users can customize the keyboard shortcut associated with a command in Safari Settings.
Web Extensions can now be loaded in [SafariDriver](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/testing-with-webdriver-in-safari). This feature allows developers to test their extension in an automated setting. Using Selenium, you can register custom commands to utilize this new feature.

```
driver = webdriver.Safari()

driver.command_executor._commands["load_web_extension"] = (
    "POST", "/session/$sessionId/webextension"
)
driver.command_executor._commands["unload_web_extension"] = (
    "DELETE", "/session/$sessionId/webextension/$extension_id"
)

```

Learn more about these commands in the documentation on the WebExtensions Community Group [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/webextensions/blob/main/specification/webdriver-classic.bs).
New since WWDC25, Safari 26.0 adds support for Web Extension for `dom.openOrClosedShadowRoot()`.
##  Content Blockers
[Content blockers](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SafariServices/creating-a-content-blocker) are a kind of extension that give Safari a set of rules to use to block content in the browser window. Blocking behaviors include hiding elements, blocking loads, and stripping cookies from Safari requests.
Safari 26.0 includes three new features for content blockers:
  * `unless-frame-url`
  * the request-method content blocker trigger field
  * `isContentRuleListRedirect`


##  WebAssembly
As WebAssembly continues to grow in popularity, WebKit has been improving WebAssembly performance across the board. Now, WebAssembly is first evaluated by our new in-place interpreter. This allows large WebAssembly modules to launch even faster and use less memory, while retaining the same top end throughput after warming up.
##  Networking
WebKit now supports `<link rel=dns-prefetch>` on iOS, iPadOS, and visionOS. It gives a hint to the browser to perform a DNS lookup in the background to improve performance. Supported on macOS since Safari 5, it now has improved privacy.
##  Privacy
In our continuing efforts to improve privacy and protect users, Safari 26.0 now prevents known fingerprinting scripts from reliably accessing web APIs that may reveal device characteristics, such as screen dimensions, hardware concurrency, the list of voices available through the SpeechSynthesis API,  Pay payment capabilities, web audio readback, 2D canvas and more. Safari additionally prevents these scripts from setting long-lived script-written storage such as cookies or LocalStorage. And lastly, Safari prevents known fingerprinting scripts from reading state that could be used for navigational tracking, such as query parameters and `document.referrer`.
##  Lockdown Mode
Available on iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS, [Lockdown Mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/105120) is an optional, extreme protection that’s designed for the very few individuals who, because of who they are or what they do, might be personally targeted by some of the most sophisticated digital threats. This includes limiting some of what websites can do to ensure the highest level of protection.
Since its beginning, Lockdown Mode disallowed the use of most web fonts. Now instead, web fonts are evaluated by the new Safe Font Parser, and if they pass the evaluation, they are allowed. This means almost all content will be displayed using the specified web fonts in Lockdown Mode.
##  Device management
[Device management](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/intro-to-device-management-profiles-depc0aadd3fe/web) lets an administrator securely and remotely configure devices. It’s often used when a fleet of devices is used by a lot of people at work or school, and the administrator responsible for those devices needs tooling for more easily taking care of them all.
Safari 26.0 adds two new features to further support device management. Now a managed device can have a folder of managed bookmarks. And a managed device can have managed new tab or new window page (home page, blank page, extension new tab page).
##  Security
Security improvements in Safari 26.0 include adding support enforcing the `Integrity-Policy` header on script destinations. And adding a new configuration to support Google Safe Browsing version 5 traffic to Safari and WebKit clients with the web browser entitlement.
##  Bug fixes and more
