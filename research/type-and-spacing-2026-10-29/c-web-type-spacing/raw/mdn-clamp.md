The 
clamp()

CSS

function
 clamps a value within a range of values between a defined minimum bound and a maximum bound. The function takes three parameters: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum allowed value.

Try it

font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem);

font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 2.5vw, 4rem);

font-size: clamp(1rem, 10vw, 2rem);

<section class="default-example" id="default-example">
  <div class="transition-all" id="example-element">
    The font-size of this text varies depending on the base font of the page,
    and the size of the viewport.
  </div>
</section>

Note that using 
clamp()
 for font sizes, as in these examples, allows you to set a font-size that grows with the size of the viewport, but doesn't go below a minimum font-size or above a maximum font-size. It has the same effect as the code in 
Fluid Typography
 but in one line, and without the use of media queries.

Syntax

css
/* Static values */
width: clamp(200px, 40%, 400px);
width: clamp(20rem, 30vw, 70rem);
width: clamp(10vw, 20em, 100vw);

/* Calculated values */
width: clamp(min(10vw, 20rem), 300px, max(90vw, 55rem));
width: clamp(100px, calc(30% / 2rem + 10px), 900px);

Parameters

The 
clamp(min, val, max)
 function accepts three comma-separated expressions as its parameters.

min

The minimum value is the smallest (most negative) value. This is the lower bound in the range of allowed values. If the preferred value is less than this value, the minimum value will be used.

val

The preferred value is the expression whose value will be used as long as the result is between the minimum and maximum values.

max

The maximum value is the largest (most positive) expression value to which the value of the property will be assigned if the preferred value is greater than this upper bound.

The expressions can be math functions (see 
calc()
 for more information), literal values, other expressions that evaluate to a valid argument type (like 
<length>
), or nested 
min()
 and 
max()
 functions. For math expressions, you can use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without using the 
calc()
 function itself. You may also use parentheses to establish computation order when needed.

You can use different units for each value in your expressions and different units in any math function making up any of the arguments.

Keep the following aspects in mind while working with the function:

Math expressions involving percentages for widths and heights on table columns, table column groups, table rows, table row groups, and table cells in both auto and fixed layout tables 
may
 be treated as if 
auto
 had been specified.

It is permitted to nest 
max()
 and 
min()
 functions as expression values, in which case the inner ones are treated as basic parentheses. The expressions are full math expressions, so you can use direct addition, subtraction, multiplication and division without using the 
calc()
 function itself.

The expression can be values combining the addition (
+
), subtraction (
-
), multiplication (
*
), and division (
/
) operators, using standard operator precedence rules. Make sure to put a space on each side of the 
+
 and 
-
 operands. You can use different units for each value in your expression. You may also use parentheses to establish computation order when needed.

Oftentimes you will want to use 
min()
 and 
max()
 within a 
clamp()
 function.

Return value

clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX)
 is resolved as 
max(MIN, min(VAL, MAX))
.

Based on the provided parameters, the function returns 
<length>
, 
<frequency>
, 
<angle>
, 
<time>
, 
<percentage>
, 
<number>
, or 
<integer>
.

Examples

min(), max(), and clamp() comparison

In this example we have a web page that uses 
min()
, 
max()
, and 
clamp()
 to set sizes responsively.

The example adjusts the sizes of page elements in three ways:

the lengths of the lines of text

the font size of paragraph text

the font size of heading text

In all three cases, the page uses a combination of a viewport-relative units (
vw
 and 
<percentage>
), to set a size that varies with the viewport width, and a value that is not viewport relative (
rem
 and 
px
) to implement minimum and/or maximum sizes.

The example is at 
https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/min-max-clamp/
. Open it in a new window and try adjusting the window width.

The 
line length
 (controlled by the 
width
 of the 
<body>
 element) will increase as the window width increases, but only up to a certain point (
1000px
), and beyond that point, it won't increase anymore. We're using 
min()
 to set a 
maximum line length
: it can go under 
1000px
, but won't go over. This is helpful because long lines are harder to read, so we often want to limit how long a line can be. To achieve this we use 
min(1000px, calc(70% + 100px))
: when the result of the percentage-based calculation goes above 
1000px
, we switch to the fixed 
1000px
 value.

The 
size of the paragraph text
, controlled by the 
font-size
 of the 
<p>
 element, decreases as the window gets narrower, but only up to a certain point, and beyond that point (the point where 
1.2vw
 is less than 
1.2rem
) it doesn't get any smaller: it stays at 
1.2rem
. We're using 
max()
 to set a 
minimum font size
: the font can grow above 
1.2rem
 but will never go below it. This is helpful because really small text is hard to read. To achieve this we use 
max(1.2rem, 1.2vw)
. This means that the 
font-size
 will be set at 
1.2rem
, unless the computed value of 
1.2vw
 is greater than that of 
1.2rem
, in which case it will be set to 
1.2vw
 instead.

The 
size of the heading text
, controlled by the 
font-size
 of the 
<h1>
 element, has a viewport-relative value with both a maximum and a minimum threshold. To achieve this we use 
clamp(1.8rem, 2.5vw, 2.8rem)
. The viewport-relative value is 
2.5vw
 but it is clamped between 
1.8rem
 and 
2.8rem
, so:

if the calculated value of 
2.5vw
 is less than 
1.8rem
, then 
1.8rem
 will be used

if the calculated value of 
2.5vw
 is greater than 
2.8rem
, then 
2.8rem
 will be used.

This prevents the heading text from getting too small in a very narrow window, or too big in a very wide window.

CSS

css
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

body {
  margin: 0 auto;
  width: min(1000px, calc(70% + 100px));
}

h1 {
  letter-spacing: 2px;
  font-size: clamp(1.8rem, 2.5vw, 2.8rem);
}

p {
  line-height: 1.5;
  font-size: max(1.2rem, 1.2vw);
}

Accessibility

When 
clamp()
 is used for controlling text size, make sure that the maximum allowed value is a 
relative length unit
 that is no less than twice the minimum allowed value, for example:

css
font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 2rem);

This helps to ensure that text size can scale to at least 200% if the page is zoomed.
